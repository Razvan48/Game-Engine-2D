# Game-Engine-2D | _C++, OpenGL, component-based design, entity-based system, object-oriented programming, animations_

&emsp; This is a 2D Game Engine based on CBD and EBS to a certain extend. <br/>
&emsp; Several components are implemented in the engine, such as hitbox, texture box, gravity, animation, input and others. <br/>
&emsp; Used OOP to a great extend. <br/>
&emsp; Can be used to build simple 2D games, similar to the Demo. <br/>
